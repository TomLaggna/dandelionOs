# Function Interface

The functions provided contain the interface between functions and the
surrounding code.

## Input and Output Interface
The input and output interface are built to organize the interaction between
Dandelion and the function for the purpose of reading inputs and writing
outputs.
This is done by storing them in the function memory in a format that Dandelion
understands and can safely interact with.
